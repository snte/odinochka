      <h2>Short Tutorial</h2>

      Odinochka is a tab vault, in the style of OneTab or Toby, but
      developer-centric. It is designed to be lightweight yet featureful.
      <p></p>

      <h3>Saving Tabs</h3>
      Instead of closing a tab and losing it forever, or opening 300 tabs,
      crashing your browser, and losing all of them forever, you can save tabs
      to Odinochka's database.
      <p>
        To save your current tab to Odinochka, click the extension's icon on
        your toolbar (or press Alt-T).
      </p>

      <p>
        Right clicking the icon will show a context menu, containing several
        variants to save groups of tabs all at once.
      </p>

      <p></p>

      <h3>Viewing and Restoring Tabs</h3>
      Click 'show' in the toolbar menu (or Alt-Shift-O) to view your saved tabs.
      'help' will show this page.
      <p>
        Tabs are organized into groups. To open a whole group of tabs at once,
        shift-double click the title. You can also click the pop-up x to delete
        a group.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can edit group names by double clicking on a group header (press tab
        when done). If you add the word "lock" to a group name, you will be
        prevented from deleting it.
      </p>

      <p>You can also drag-and-drop to organize your lists of tabs.</p>

      <p>
        Clicking the popdown arrow after a youtube link will open a mini-player.
        There's a handler in the inside corner to resize it - double click the
        handle to close the player.
      </p>

      <h2>Options</h2>

      Click the hamburger icon (&#x2630;) in the footer of Odinocha to pop open
      an options dialog, which will allow you to adjust how Odinochka saves and
      restores tabs.
